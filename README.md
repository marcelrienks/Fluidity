![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-custom-lightgrey)

## Overview

Fluidity tunnels HTTP/HTTPS/WebSocket traffic through restrictive firewalls using mutual TLS authentication between a local agent and cloud-hosted server.

**Stack**: Go, Docker, AWS ECS Fargate, Lambda  
**Size**: ~44MB Alpine containers  
**Security**: mTLS with private CA

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Generate certificates locally
./scripts/manage-certs.sh

# 2. Push Docker image to ECR
make -f Makefile.<platform> push-server

# 3. Deploy to AWS (certificates passed as parameters)
./scripts/deploy-fluidity.sh fargate deploy

# 4. Run agent locally (uses certificates from ./certs/)
make -f Makefile.<platform> run-agent-local

# 5. Set browser proxy to localhost:8080

# 6. Test
curl -x http://127.0.0.1:8080 http://example.com
```

## Architecture
**‚Üí Full details:** [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture.md)
Fluidity uses a **client-server architecture** with mTLS authentication for secure tunneling through restrictive firewalls.

**Key Components:**
- **Agent** (local proxy): Accepts HTTP/HTTPS requests on port 8080, forwards to server via WebSocket tunnel
- **Server** (cloud-based): Receives tunneled requests, performs HTTP calls, returns responses
- **Protocol**: Custom WebSocket-based with request/response IDs, connection pooling, auto-reconnection
- **Security**: Mutual TLS with private CA certificates, no plaintext credentials

## Deployment
**‚Üí Full deployment details:** [Deployment Guide](docs/deployment.md)

Fluidity supports multiple deployment options for different use cases:

- **Development**: Local and Docker environments for testing and debugging
- **Production**: AWS Fargate for the server, local agent, with optional Lambda control plane for cost optimization
- **Infrastructure as Code**: CloudFormation templates for automated, repeatable deployments

**Recommended Production Setup:**
1. Generate certificates locally (`./scripts/manage-certs.sh`)
2. Push Docker image to ECR (`make -f Makefile.<platform> push-server`)
3. Deploy Fargate server via CloudFormation - certificates passed as parameters (`./scripts/deploy-fluidity.sh fargate deploy`)
4. Deploy Lambda control plane for on-demand operation (`./scripts/deploy-fluidity.sh lambda deploy`)
5. Run agent locally with certificates from ./certs/
6. Total cost: ~$0.11-0.21/month with on-demand lifecycle management

### Development
Local development and testing options for building and contributing to Fluidity.

#### **üè† Local**
Run both server and agent on your local machine.

**Quick Setup:**
```bash
# 1. Run locally
make -f Makefile.<platform> run-server-local  # Terminal 1
make -f Makefile.<platform> run-agent-local   # Terminal 2

# 2. Test
make -f Makefile.<platform> test
```

**Best for:** Development, testing, debugging  
**Cost:** Free

#### **üê≥ Docker**
**‚Üí Full details:** [Development Guide](docs/development.md) | [Docker Guide](docs/docker.md)
Build and run containerized images locally with Docker Desktop.

**Commands:**
```bash
# Build images
make -f Makefile.<platform> build-server
make -f Makefile.<platform> build-agent

# Run containers
make -f Makefile.<platform> run-server
make -f Makefile.<platform> run-agent
```

**Details:** Alpine Linux base, ~44MB per image, includes TLS certificates  
**Best for:** Testing containerization before cloud deployment  
**Cost:** Free

**Project Structure:**
- `cmd/` - Main entry points (server, agent, lambdas)
- `internal/core/` - Server and agent business logic
- `internal/shared/` - Reusable utilities (protocol, retry, circuit breaker, logging)
- `internal/lambdas/` - Control plane functions (wake, sleep, kill)

**Testing:** 75+ tests with ~77% coverage (unit, integration, E2E)

### Production (Recommended: CloudFormation)
Deploy to AWS using **Infrastructure as Code** for automated, repeatable, cost-effective infrastructure.

**Quick Deploy:**
```bash
./scripts/deploy-fluidity.sh fargate deploy  # Deploy server infrastructure
./scripts/deploy-fluidity.sh lambda deploy   # Deploy control plane
```

#### **üíª Agent (Local)**
The agent runs locally on your machine and connects to the cloud-hosted server.

**Setup:**
```bash
# 1. Generate certificates (if not already done)
./scripts/manage-certs.sh

# 2. Configure agent
# Edit configs/agent.yaml with Fargate server public IP

# 3. Run agent
make -f Makefile.<platform> run-agent-local
```

**Configuration:**
- Connects to Fargate server via WebSocket over mTLS
- Proxy port: 8080 (configurable)
- Auto-reconnection with exponential backoff

#### **‚òÅÔ∏è Server (Fargate)**
**‚Üí Details:** [Infrastructure Documentation](docs/infrastructure.md) | [AWS Fargate Guide](docs/fargate.md)
Serverless container platform running the Fluidity server without managing EC2 instances.

**What's deployed:**
- ECS cluster with Fargate launch type
- Task definition (0.25 vCPU, 512 MB memory)
- VPC, subnets, security groups
- CloudWatch logs and monitoring
- Public IP for agent connectivity

**CloudFormation:**
```bash
# Generate certificates first
./scripts/manage-certs.sh

# Deploy via script (certificates passed from ./certs/ directory)
./scripts/deploy-fluidity.sh fargate deploy

# Or use template directly (must pass certificate parameters)
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name fluidity-fargate \
  --template-body file://deployments/cloudformation/fargate.yaml \
  --parameters file://deployments/cloudformation/params.json \
    ParameterKey=CertPem,ParameterValue=$(base64 -i ./certs/server.crt | tr -d '\n') \
    ParameterKey=KeyPem,ParameterValue=$(base64 -i ./certs/server.key | tr -d '\n') \
    ParameterKey=CaPem,ParameterValue=$(base64 -i ./certs/ca.crt | tr -d '\n') \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```

**Manual Deployment:**
```bash
# 1. Push image to ECR
make -f Makefile.<platform> push-server

# 2. Create task definition (AWS Console or CLI)
# 3. Start service
aws ecs update-service --cluster fluidity --service server --desired-count 1

# 4. Get public IP
aws ecs describe-tasks --cluster fluidity --tasks <task-arn> | grep "publicIp"
```

**Cost:** $0.50-3/month (24/7) or $0.10-0.20/month (on-demand with Lambda)

#### **‚ö° Control Plane (Lambda + API Gateway)**
**‚Üí Details:** [Infrastructure Documentation](docs/infrastructure.md) | [Lambda Functions Guide](docs/lambda.md)
Automated lifecycle management to minimize costs with on-demand server operation.

**Components:**
- **Wake Function** - Starts Fargate server (API Gateway endpoint)
- **Sleep Function** - Auto-scales to 0 after idle (EventBridge scheduler, every 5 min)
- **Kill Function** - Immediate shutdown (API Gateway endpoint)
- **API Gateway** - HTTP endpoints for Wake/Kill functions
- **EventBridge** - Scheduled Sleep automation

**CloudFormation:**
```bash
# Deploy via script
./scripts/deploy-fluidity.sh lambda deploy

# Or use template directly
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name fluidity-lambda \
  --template-body file://deployments/cloudformation/lambda.yaml \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

**API Usage:**
```bash
# Wake server (start on-demand)
curl -X POST https://<api-id>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/wake

# Kill server (immediate shutdown)
curl -X POST https://<api-id>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/kill
```

**Cost Optimization:**
- Fargate: $0.50-3/month (24/7) ‚Üí $0.10-0.20/month (on-demand)
- Lambda: ~$0.01/month (1000 invocations)
- **Total: ~$0.11-0.21/month** (90% savings for occasional use)

#### **üîê Certificates**
**‚Üí Full details:** [Certificate Guide](docs/certificate.md)
mTLS certificates for secure authentication between agent and server.

**Generate Certificates (Required for both Dev and Prod):**
```bash
./scripts/manage-certs.sh  # Generates certificates in ./certs/ directory
```

**For Production (AWS):**
- Certificates are generated locally using the script above
- CloudFormation deployment reads certificates from ./certs/ and creates Secrets Manager secret
- Secrets Manager secret is part of the CloudFormation stack (managed lifecycle)
- Server pulls certificates from Secrets Manager at runtime
- Agent uses certificates from local ./certs/ directory

**For Local Development:**
- Same script generates certificates in ./certs/
- Both server and agent read directly from ./certs/

**Certificate Storage:**
- **Local Files** (./certs/): Primary source, used by deployment script
  - `ca.crt`, `ca.key` - CA certificate and key
  - `server.crt`, `server.key` - Server certificate (sent to AWS)
  - `client.crt`, `client.key` - Client certificate (used by agent)
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: `fluidity/certificates` (created by CloudFormation)
  - Contains Base64-encoded `cert_pem`, `key_pem`, `ca_pem`
  - Populated from local files during deployment
  - Deleted when stack is deleted

**Certificate Rotation:**
1. Generate new certificates: `./scripts/manage-certs.sh`
2. Redeploy CloudFormation stack (updates Secrets Manager)
3. Restart Fargate server (pulls new certificates from Secrets Manager)
4. Restart local agent (uses new certificates from ./certs/)

**Security:** Private CA, 4096-bit RSA, SHA-256, 2-year validity

## Operations
**‚Üí Full details:** [Operational Runbook](docs/runbook.md)
