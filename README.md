![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-custom-lightgrey)

## Overview

Fluidity tunnels HTTP/HTTPS/WebSocket traffic through restrictive firewalls using mutual TLS authentication between a local agent and cloud-hosted server.

**Stack**: Go, Docker, AWS ECS Fargate, Lambda  
**Size**: ~44MB Alpine containers  
**Security**: mTLS with private CA

## Features

✅ HTTP/HTTPS/WebSocket tunneling  
✅ mTLS authentication  
✅ Auto-reconnection  
✅ Cross-platform (Windows/macOS/Linux)  
✅ 75+ tests, ~77% coverage  
🚧 Lambda-based lifecycle automation

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Generate certificates
./scripts/generate-certs.sh  # macOS/Linux
.\scripts\generate-certs.ps1  # Windows

# 2. Run server and agent
make -f Makefile.<platform> run-server-local  # Terminal 1
make -f Makefile.<platform> run-agent-local   # Terminal 2

# 3. Set browser proxy to localhost:8080

# 4. Test
curl -x http://127.0.0.1:8080 http://example.com
```
