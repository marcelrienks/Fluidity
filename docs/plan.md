# Project Plan

Development roadmap by phase.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure âœ… COMPLETE

**Goal:** Working HTTP/HTTPS/WebSocket tunnel with mTLS

**Completed:**
- [x] mTLS authentication with private CA
- [x] HTTP tunneling
- [x] HTTPS CONNECT tunneling  
- [x] WebSocket support
- [x] Circuit breaker pattern
- [x] Retry logic with exponential backoff
- [x] Auto-reconnection
- [x] Docker containerization (~44MB images)
- [x] Cross-platform support (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- [x] 75+ tests (~77% coverage)
- [x] E2E test automation scripts

## Phase 2: Lambda Control Plane ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS

**Goal:** Automated lifecycle management with cost optimization

**Completed:**
- [x] Lambda functions (Wake/Sleep/Kill)
- [x] CloudFormation templates (Fargate + Lambda stacks)
- [x] Deployment automation scripts
- [x] CloudWatch metrics and dashboards
- [x] EventBridge schedulers

**In Progress:**
- [ ] Agent lifecycle integration (Wake/Kill API calls)
- [ ] Server metrics emission
- [ ] End-to-end lifecycle testing

## Phase 3: Production Hardening ðŸ“‹ PLANNED

**Goals:**
- Production-ready security
- CI/CD automation
- Enhanced monitoring

**Planned:**
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Production certificate management (trusted CA)
- [ ] Enhanced error handling
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Load testing
- [ ] Documentation updates
