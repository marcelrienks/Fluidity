- [x] Develop integration tests for HTTPS/CONNECT tunneling (Oct 2025 - integrated into test-docker.ps1/.sh)
- [x] Add WebSocket testing support (Oct 2025 - optional test step in test-local.ps1/.sh and test-docker.ps1/.sh)
- [x] Automated test scripts for Docker containers (Oct 2025 - test-docker.ps1/.sh)
- [x] Automated test scripts for local binaries (Oct 2025 - test-local.ps1/.sh)
- [ ] Expand test coverage for edge cases and error scenarios
- [ ] Performance and load testing

### Documentation âœ… MOSTLY COMPLETE
- [x] Comprehensive README with quick start guides (Oct 2025)
- [x] Architecture design document (Oct 2025)

### Cloud Deployment ðŸš§ NOT STARTED
- [ ] Deploy Tunnel Server to a cloud provider (initial deployment)
- [ ] Configure cloud networking and firewall rules
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Document cloud deployment procedures

### Performance & Monitoring ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS
- [x] Implement concurrent request handling (Oct 2025 - goroutines and channels in place)
- [ ] Optimize connection pooling
- [ ] Add health checks and monitoring endpoints
- [ ] Implement metrics collection

---


## Phase 2: Cloud Deployment

### Deployment & Scaling
- [ ] Deploy Tunnel Server to chosen cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)
- [ ] Implement container orchestration (Docker Compose, Kubernetes, or cloud container services)
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated builds and deployments
- [ ] Implement scaling and monitoring for cloud deployment

### Configuration & Networking
- [ ] Handle dynamic IP address changes for cloud deployments
- [ ] Secure cloud networking and firewall rules
