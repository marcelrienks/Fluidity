## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Outstanding Work)

### Protocol Support
- [x] Implement HTTPS/CONNECT tunneling (COMPLETE - implemented in tunnel client/server)
- [x] Implement WebSocket support (COMPLETE - full bidirectional WebSocket tunneling implemented)

### Security
- [x] mTLS certificate generation and integration (COMPLETE - certificates exist in certs/)
- [x] Secure TLS verification (COMPLETE - no InsecureSkipVerify found in codebase)

### Error Handling & Reliability
- [ ] Improve error handling and recovery throughout agent and server
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker pattern for external requests
- [x] Enhance retry logic for connection attempts (COMPLETE - reconnection logic implemented)
- [ ] Enhance retry logic for request forwarding

### Testing
- [x] Develop integration tests for HTTP tunneling (COMPLETE - integrated into test scripts)
- [x] Develop integration tests for HTTPS/CONNECT tunneling (COMPLETE - integrated into test scripts)
- [x] Add WebSocket testing support (COMPLETE - optional test step in all test scripts)
- [ ] Test and analyze detection by endpoint security tools (EDR/AV)
- [ ] Implement mitigations to avoid triggering security monitoring alerts

### Documentation
- [ ] Finalize user guides and deployment instructions
- [ ] Expand troubleshooting and FAQ sections

### Cloud Deployment
- [ ] Deploy Tunnel Server to a cloud provider (initial deployment)

### Performance & Monitoring
- [x] Implement concurrent request handling (COMPLETE - goroutines and channels in place)
- [ ] Optimize connection pooling
- [ ] Add health checks and monitoring endpoints

---


## Phase 2: Cloud Deployment

### Deployment & Scaling
- [ ] Deploy Tunnel Server to chosen cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)
- [ ] Implement container orchestration (Docker Compose, Kubernetes, or cloud container services)
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated builds and deployments
- [ ] Implement scaling and monitoring for cloud deployment

### Configuration & Networking
- [ ] Handle dynamic IP address changes for cloud deployments
- [ ] Secure cloud networking and firewall rules

---

## Phase 3: Enhanced Features

### Security & Certificates
- [x] Implement basic mTLS authentication (COMPLETE - working in current code)
- [ ] Implement advanced certificate management (monitoring, alerts)
- [x] Private Certificate Authority (CA) infrastructure (COMPLETE - certs/ directory)
- [ ] Implement certificate renewal and rotation automation

### Configuration & Usability
- [x] Basic configuration options (COMPLETE - CLI, config files, environment variables)
- [x] Server IP configuration with CLI override (COMPLETE - implemented in agent)
- [ ] Configuration hot-reload capability
- [ ] Enhanced configuration validation

### Monitoring & Logging
- [x] Basic structured logging (COMPLETE - using logrus with contextual fields)
- [ ] Add monitoring endpoints and health checks
- [ ] Enhanced logging capabilities (metrics, performance tracking)

---

## Phase 4: Testing & Documentation

### Testing
- [ ] Comprehensive unit, integration, and performance tests
- [ ] End-to-end test scenarios with real servers
- [ ] Security audit and vulnerability assessment

### Documentation
- [ ] Complete user documentation and guides
- [ ] Finalize troubleshooting and FAQ sections
- [ ] Document cloud deployment and scaling procedures
